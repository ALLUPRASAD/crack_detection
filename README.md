# Crack Detection

## 1. Synthetic Data Generation
Synthetic data is generated using various augmentation techniques to simulate real-world crack patterns. Below are the steps:


1. Load base images

   </p>  
                                        .⬇  
2. Detecting edges

## 2. Model Training
A deep learning model is trained using a dataset of crack and non-crack images. The model architecture is based on CNNs (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet).

### Training Steps:
1. Load dataset  
2. Preprocess images  
3. Train using CNN-based architecture  
4. Validate on test dataset  
5. Fine-tune hyperparameters  
6. Save trained model

## 3. Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of **X%** on the validation set. Below is the confusion matrix and loss/accuracy graph.

## 4. Image Detections
The trained model is used to detect cracks in new images. Below are sample detections.
