## 1. Synthetic Data Generation
" >> README.md
echo "Synthetic data is generated using various augmentation techniques to simulate real-world crack patterns. Below are the steps:" >> README.md
echo "
1. Load base images
2. Apply random transformations (rotation, noise, contrast, etc.)
3. Generate labeled datasets for model training
4. Save the generated dataset" >> README.md

## 2. Model Training
" >> README.md
echo "A deep learning model is trained using a dataset of crack and non-crack images. The model architecture is based on CNNs (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet)." >> README.md
echo "
### Training Steps:
1. Load dataset
2. Preprocess images
3. Train using CNN-based architecture
4. Validate on test dataset
5. Fine-tune hyperparameters
6. Save trained model
